    "It turns out that we can use the words in Trump's tweets to calculate a measure of the sentiment of the tweet. For example, the sentence \"I love America!\" has positive sentiment, whereas the sentence \"I hate taxes!\" has a negative sentiment. In addition, some words have stronger positive / negative sentiment than others: \"I love America.\" is more positive than \"I like America.\"\n",

    "We will use the [VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) lexicon to analyze the sentiment of Trump's tweets. VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media which is great for our usage.\n",

    "1. True. As seen in our list of Top 20 words, we have words like \"try\" and \"maybe\" in the list, which are both not nouns. However, this does not seem to be a clear confounding factor for the popularity of Kim Jong Un tweets. Were non-noun words filtered out, \"kim\", \"jong\" and \"un\" would still retain their place at the top of the list. \n",
    "2. False. During the filtering process, we took out all punctuation and made a column named \"no_punc\" which contained all tweets without any punctuation. \n",
    "3. True. We have not considered how Trump's twitter following has increased over time. It is not immediately obvious whether or not this is a confounding factor. Trump started posting tweets involved with Kim Jong Un in 2016 up until present day in 2018, which is the same time span that the dataset covers. An increase in his followers from 2016 to 2018 might not be able to account for why these certain tweets are so highly retweeted if Trump has already been tweeting about Kim Jong Un since 2016. On the other hand, we do not know if Trump tweets about Kim Jong Un more oftenly now than he did in earlier years. In this case, the more posts he makes about Kim will be seen by more and more people everyday, which may contribute to its popularity. "

    "With this distribution, I wanted to look at the relationship between sentiments of tweets and their retweet count. The basic scatterplot above illustrates a blob-like distribution between the two features of interest. Most data points are contained within a band of values from 0 to 100,000 regardless of polarity. One interesting characteristic of this plot is the sparse trail of tweets stemming from the center of the distribution. These tweets have a much higher retweet count than the rest of the data, yet they are all mostly neutral sentiments. This seems a bit counterintuitive since one would expect that more emotional language would lead to a greater reaction within his followers, but this is not the case. Overall, there doesn't seem to be a clear relationship between a tweet's sentiment and the amount of retweets it receives."
