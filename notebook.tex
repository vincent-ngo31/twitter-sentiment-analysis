account working: 1. Run the cell to set up your notebook below (the one
that starts with import csv). 2. Skip Question 1 and Question 2a. 3.
Start with Question 2a-X instead. 4. After completing 2a-X, continue on
to question 2b and proceed as normal.

    \section{Project 1: Trump, Twitter, and
Text}\label{project-1-trump-twitter-and-text}

Welcome to the first project of Data 100! In this project, we will work
with the Twitter API in order to analyze Donald Trump's tweets.

\textbf{The project is due 11:59pm Thursday, October 25, California
Time.}

You do not have to work on this project before the midterm, but you
might find it helpful, since it goes over a lot of pandas materials that
we haven't used in a while.

\textbf{Fun:}

We intend this project to be fun! You will analyze actual data from the
Twitter API. You will also draw conclusions about the current (and often
controversial) US President's tweet behavior. If you find yourself
getting frustrated or stuck on one problem for too long, we suggest
coming into office hours and working with friends in the class.

With that in mind, let's get started!

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

Since we'll be looking at Twitter data, we need to download the data
from Twitter!

Twitter provides an API for downloading tweet data in large batches. The
\texttt{tweepy} package makes it fairly easy to use.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}3}]:} \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{}\PYZsh{} Make sure you are in your data100 conda environment if you are working locally.}
        \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} The following should run:}
        \PY{k+kn}{import} \PY{n+nn}{tweepy}
\end{Verbatim}


    There are instructions on using \texttt{tweepy}
\href{http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/getting_started.html}{here},
but we will give you example code.

Twitter requires you to have authentication keys to access their API. To
get your keys, you'll have to sign up as a Twitter developer. The next
question will walk you through this process.

    \subsection{Question 1}\label{question-1}

Follow the instructions below to get your Twitter API keys. \textbf{Read
the instructions completely before starting.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://twitter.com}{Create a Twitter account}. You can use an
  existing account if you have one; if you prefer to not do this
  assignment under your regular account, feel free to create a
  throw-away account.
\item
  Under account settings, add your phone number to the account.
\item
  \href{https://dev.twitter.com/resources/signup}{Create a Twitter
  developer account} by clicking the 'Apply' button on the top right of
  the page. Attach it to your Twitter account. You'll have to fill out a
  form describing what you want to do with the developer account.
  Explain that you are doing this for a class at UC Berkeley and that
  you don't know exactly what you're building yet and just need the
  account to get started. These applications are approved by some sort
  of AI system, so it doesn't matter exactly what you write. Just don't
  enter a bunch of alweiofalwiuhflawiuehflawuihflaiwhfe type stuff or
  you might get rejected.
\item
  Once you're logged into your developer account,
  \href{https://apps.twitter.com/app/new}{create an application for this
  assignment}. You can call it whatever you want, and you can write any
  URL when it asks for a web site. You don't need to provide a callback
  URL.
\item
  On the page for that application, find your Consumer Key and Consumer
  Secret.
\item
  On the same page, create an Access Token. Record the resulting Access
  Token and Access Token Secret.
\item
  Edit the file \url{keys.json} and replace the placeholders with your
  keys.
\end{enumerate}

    \subsection{WARNING (Please Read) !!!!}\label{warning-please-read}

\subsubsection{Protect your Twitter
Keys}\label{protect-your-twitter-keys}

{ If someone has your authentication keys, they can access your Twitter
account and post as you! So don't give them to anyone, and \textbf{don't
write them down in this notebook}. } The usual way to store sensitive
information like this is to put it in a separate file and read it
programmatically. That way, you can share the rest of your code without
sharing your keys. That's why we're asking you to put your keys in
\texttt{keys.json} for this assignment.

\subsubsection{Avoid making too many API
calls.}\label{avoid-making-too-many-api-calls.}

{ Twitter limits developers to a certain rate of requests for data. If
you make too many requests in a short period of time, you'll have to
wait awhile (around 15 minutes) before you can make more. } So carefully
follow the code examples you see and don't rerun cells without thinking.
Instead, always save the data you've collected to a file. We've provided
templates to help you do that.

\subsubsection{Be careful about which functions you
call!}\label{be-careful-about-which-functions-you-call}

{ This API can retweet tweets, follow and unfollow people, and modify
your twitter settings. Be careful which functions you invoke! } One of
the sp18 instructors accidentally re-tweeted some tweets because that
instructor typed \texttt{retweet} instead of \texttt{retweet\_count}.

    \subsubsection{Question 2a-X}\label{question-2a-x}

    This alternate starting point is here for those of you who have trouble
getting a Twitter developer account. You should only use this if Twitter
has rejected your application or if they have gone silent on you for at
least a day. You'll miss out on some of the learning experience... but
it seems like this might be necessary for some. If your twitter account
is working fine, skip this problem!

    Start by running the following cells, which will download and then load
Donald Trump's most recent tweets.

    If everything is working correctly correctly this should load roughly
the last 3000 tweets by \texttt{realdonaldtrump}.

    If the assert statement above works, then continue on to question 2b.

    \subsubsection{Question 2b}\label{question-2b}

We are limited to how many tweets we can download. In what month is the
oldest tweet from Trump?

    \subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}

\textbf{IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ}

Unfortunately, even if you have a working Twitter developer account, you
cannot download older tweets using the public APIs. Fortunately, we have
a snapshot of earlier tweets that we can combine with the newer data
that you downloaded

We will again use the \texttt{fetch\_and\_cache} utility to download the
dataset.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

    Since we're giving you a zipfile of old tweets, you may wonder why we
didn't just give you a zipfile of ALL tweets and save you the trouble of
creating a Twitter developer account. The reason is that we wanted you
to see what it's like to collect data from the real world on your own.
It can be a pain!

And for those of you that never got your developer accounts, you can see
it can be even more of a pain that we expected. Sorry to anybody that
wasted a bunch of time trying to get things working.

    \subsubsection{Question 3a}\label{question-3a}

Merge the \texttt{old\_trump\_tweets} and the \texttt{trump\_tweets} we
downloaded from twitter into one giant list of tweets.

\textbf{Important:} There may be some overlap so be sure to eliminate
duplicate tweets.\\
\textbf{Hint:} the \texttt{id} of a tweet is always unique.

    \subsubsection{Question 3b}\label{question-3b}

Construct a DataFrame called \texttt{trump} containing all the tweets
stored in \texttt{all\_tweets}. The index of the dataframe should be the
ID of each tweet (looks something like \texttt{907698529606541312}). It
should have these columns:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{time}: The time the tweet was created encoded as a datetime
  object. (Use \texttt{pd.to\_datetime} to encode the timestamp.)
\item
  \texttt{source}: The source device of the tweet.
\item
  \texttt{text}: The text of the tweet.
\item
  \texttt{retweet\_count}: The retweet count of the tweet.
\end{itemize}

Finally, \textbf{the resulting dataframe should be sorted by the index.}

\textbf{Warning:} \emph{Some tweets will store the text in the
\texttt{text} field and other will use the \texttt{full\_text} field.}

    \subsection{Question 4b}\label{question-4b}

Is there a difference between his Tweet behavior across these devices?
We will attempt to answer this question in our subsequent analysis.

First, we'll take a look at whether Trump's tweets from an Android come
at different times than his tweets from an iPhone. Note that Twitter
gives us his tweets in the
\href{https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_UTC_time_offsets}{UTC
timezone} (notice the \texttt{+0000} in the first few tweets)

    We'll convert the tweet times to US Eastern Time, the timezone of New
York and Washington D.C., since those are the places we would expect the
most tweet activity from Trump.

    \subsection{Question 4d}\label{question-4d}

According to
\href{https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15103504/donald-trump-iphone-using-switched-android}{this
Verge article}, Donald Trump switched from an Android to an iPhone
sometime in March 2017.

Create a figure identical to your figure from 4c, except that you should
show the results only from 2016. If you get stuck consider looking at
the \texttt{year\_fraction} function from the next problem.

During the campaign, it was theorized that Donald Trump's tweets from
Android were written by him personally, and the tweets from iPhone were
from his staff. Does your figure give support to this theory?

    The Android distribution shows that Trump tweets in the morning around 8
or 9am and in the evening around 9 or 10pm, which suggests personal
usage at the beginning and end of his day. The iPhone distribution
indicates tweets being posted throughout the day, when he is supposed to
be busy working. This suggests that his employees tweet for him during
work hours because that's their job, and he tweets on his personal free
time which is the morning and the evening.

    \subsection{Question 5}\label{question-5}

Let's now look at which device he has used over the entire time period
of this dataset.

To examine the distribution of dates we will convert the date to a
fractional year that can be plotted as a distribution.

    \subsection{Question 6: Sentiment
Analysis}\label{question-6-sentiment-analysis}

It turns out that we can use the words in Trump's tweets to calculate a
measure of the sentiment of the tweet. For example, the sentence "I love
America!" has positive sentiment, whereas the sentence "I hate taxes!"
has a negative sentiment. In addition, some words have stronger positive
/ negative sentiment than others: "I love America." is more positive
than "I like America."

We will use the \href{https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment}{VADER
(Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)} lexicon to analyze
the sentiment of Trump's tweets. VADER is a lexicon and rule-based
sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments
expressed in social media which is great for our usage.

The VADER lexicon gives the sentiment of individual words. Run the
following cell to show the first few rows of the lexicon:

    \subsection{Question 6a}\label{question-6a}

As you can see, the lexicon contains emojis too! The first column of the
lexicon is the \emph{token}, or the word itself. The second column is
the \emph{polarity} of the word, or how positive / negative it is.

(How did they decide the polarities of these words? What are the other
two columns in the lexicon? See the link above.)

Read in the lexicon into a DataFrame called \texttt{sent}. The index of
the DF should be the tokens in the lexicon. \texttt{sent} should have
one column: \texttt{polarity}: The polarity of each token.

    \subsection{Question 6b}\label{question-6b}

Now, let's use this lexicon to calculate the overall sentiment for each
of Trump's tweets. Here's the basic idea:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  For each tweet, find the sentiment of each word.
\item
  Calculate the sentiment of each tweet by taking the sum of the
  sentiments of its words.
\end{enumerate}

First, let's lowercase the text in the tweets since the lexicon is also
lowercase. Set the \texttt{text} column of the \texttt{trump} DF to be
the lowercased text of each tweet.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}


    \subsection{Question 6c}\label{question-6c}

Now, let's get rid of punctuation since it'll cause us to fail to match
words. Create a new column called \texttt{no\_punc} in the
\texttt{trump} DF to be the lowercased text of each tweet with all
punctuation replaced by a single space. We consider punctuation
characters to be any character that isn't a Unicode word character or a
whitespace character. You may want to consult the Python documentation
on regexes for this problem.

(Why don't we simply remove punctuation instead of replacing with a
space? See if you can figure this out by looking at the tweet data.)

    \subsection{Question 6d:}\label{question-6d}

Now, let's convert the tweets into what's called a
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html}{\emph{tidy
format}} to make the sentiments easier to calculate. Use the
\texttt{no\_punc} column of \texttt{trump} to create a table called
\texttt{tidy\_format}. The index of the table should be the IDs of the
tweets, repeated once for every word in the tweet. It has two columns:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{num}: The location of the word in the tweet. For example, if
  the tweet was "i love america", then the location of the word "i" is
  0, "love" is 1, and "america" is 2.
\item
  \texttt{word}: The individual words of each tweet.
\end{enumerate}

The first few rows of our \texttt{tidy\_format} table look like:

\begin{verbatim}
<tr style="text-align: right;">
  <th></th>
  <th>num</th>
  <th>word</th>
</tr>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
<tr>
  <th>894661651760377856</th>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>i</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>894661651760377856</th>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>think</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>894661651760377856</th>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>senator</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>894661651760377856</th>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>blumenthal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>894661651760377856</th>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>should</td>
</tr>
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Note that you'll get different results depending on when you
pulled in the tweets.} However, you can double check that your tweet
with ID \texttt{894661651760377856} has the same rows as ours. Our tests
don't check whether your table looks exactly like ours.

As usual, try to avoid using any for loops. Our solution uses a chain of
5 methods on the 'trump' DF, albeit using some rather advanced Pandas
hacking.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Hint 1:} Try looking at the \texttt{expand} argument to
  pandas' \texttt{str.split}.
\item
  \textbf{Hint 2:} Try looking at the \texttt{stack()} method.
\item
  \textbf{Hint 3:} Try looking at the \texttt{level} parameter of the
  \texttt{reset\_index} method.
\end{itemize}

    \subsection{Question 6e:}\label{question-6e}

Now that we have this table in the tidy format, it becomes much easier
to find the sentiment of each tweet: we can join the table with the
lexicon table.

Add a \texttt{polarity} column to the \texttt{trump} table. The
\texttt{polarity} column should contain the sum of the sentiment
polarity of each word in the text of the tweet.

\textbf{Hint} you will need to merge the \texttt{tidy\_format} and
\texttt{sent} tables and group the final answer.

   it is outrageous that poisonous synthetic heroin fentanyl comes pouring into the u.s. postal system from china. we can, and must, end this now! the senate should pass the stop act – and firmly stop this poison from killing our children and destroying our country. no more delay!

   the rigged russian witch hunt goes on and on as the “originators and founders” of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity. all credibility is gone from this terrible hoax, and much more will be lost as it proceeds. no collusion!

   james comey is a proven leaker \&amp; liar. virtually everyone in washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. he leaked classified information, for which he should be prosecuted. he lied to congress under oath. he is a weak and{\ldots}

   this is an illegally brought rigged witch hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted. it was started and paid for by crooked hillary and the democrats. phony dossier, fisa disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired. 17 angry dems? stay tuned!

   where’s the collusion? they made up a phony crime called collusion, and when there was no collusion they say there was obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed). if you fight back or say anything bad about the rigged witch hunt, they scream obstruction!

Most positive tweets:

   congratulations to patrick reed on his great and courageous masters win! when patrick had his amazing win at doral 5 years ago, people saw his great talent, and a bright future ahead. now he is the masters champion!

   my supporters are the smartest, strongest, most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history. it is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country. as we get stronger, so does our country. best numbers ever!

   thank you to all of my great supporters, really big progress being made. other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals. economy is roaring. supreme court pick getting great reviews. new poll says trump, at over 90\%, is the most popular republican in history of the party. wow!

   thank you, @wvgovernor jim justice, for that warm introduction. tonight, it was my great honor to attend the “greenbrier classic – salute to service dinner” in west virginia! god bless our veterans. god bless america - and happy independence day to all! https://t.co/v35qvcn8m6

   the republican party had a great night. tremendous voter energy and excitement, and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in november. the economy is sooo strong, and with nancy pelosi wanting to end the big tax cuts and raise taxes, why wouldn’t we win?

    \paragraph{Comment on what you
observe:}\label{comment-on-what-you-observe}

    Both distributions appear to be centered around neutral polarity.
However, the distribution of tweets containing 'nyt' seems to be shifted
slightly to the left of the one containing 'fox'. This could mean that
Trump's sentiments regarding the New York Times are less positive
compared to those mentioning Fox News.

    \subsection{Question 7: Engagement}\label{question-7-engagement}

\subsection{Question 7a}\label{question-7a}

In this problem, we'll explore which words led to a greater average
number of retweets. For example, at the time of this writing, Donald
Trump has two tweets that contain the word 'oakland' (tweets
932570628451954688 and 1016609920031117312) with 36757 and 10286
retweets respectively, for an average of 23,521.5.

Find the top 20 most retweeted words. Include only words that appear in
at least 25 tweets. As usual, try to do this without any for loops. You
can string together \textasciitilde{}7 pandas commands and get
everything done on one line.

Your \texttt{top\_20} table should have this format:

\begin{verbatim}
<tr style="text-align: right;">
  <th></th>
  <th>retweet_count</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>word</th>
  <th></th>

\end{verbatim}

    \subsection{Question 7b}\label{question-7b}

"kim", "jong" and "un" are apparently really popular in Trump's tweets!
It seems like we can conclude that his tweets involving jong are more
popular than his other tweets. Or can we?

Consider each of the statements about possible confounding factors
below. State whether each statement is true or false and explain. If the
statement is true, state whether the confounding factor could have made
kim jong un related tweets higher in the list than they should be.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We didn't restrict our word list to nouns, so we have unhelpful words
  like "let" and "any" in our result.
\item
  We didn't remove hashtags in our text, so we have duplicate words (eg.
  \#great and great).
\item
  We didn't account for the fact that Trump's follower count has
  increased over time.
\end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  True. As seen in our list of Top 20 words, we have words like "try"
  and "maybe" in the list, which are both not nouns. However, this does
  not seem to be a clear confounding factor for the popularity of Kim
  Jong Un tweets. Were non-noun words filtered out, "kim", "jong" and
  "un" would still retain their place at the top of the list.
\item
  False. During the filtering process, we took out all punctuation and
  made a column named "no\_punc" which contained all tweets without any
  punctuation.
\item
  True. We have not considered how Trump's twitter following has
  increased over time. It is not immediately obvious whether or not this
  is a confounding factor. Trump started posting tweets involved with
  Kim Jong Un in 2016 up until present day in 2018, which is the same
  time span that the dataset covers. An increase in his followers from
  2016 to 2018 might not be able to account for why these certain tweets
  are so highly retweeted if Trump has already been tweeting about Kim
  Jong Un since 2016. On the other hand, we do not know if Trump tweets
  about Kim Jong Un more oftenly now than he did in earlier years. In
  this case, the more posts he makes about Kim will be seen by more and
  more people everyday, which may contribute to its popularity.
\end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Question 8}\label{question-8}

Using the \texttt{trump} tweets construct an interesting plot describing
a property of the data and discuss what you found below.

\textbf{Ideas:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How has the sentiment changed with length of the tweets?
\item
  Does sentiment affect retweet count?
\item
  Are retweets more negative than regular tweets?
\item
  Are there any spikes in the number of retweets and do the correspond
  to world events?
\item
  \emph{Bonus:} How many Russian twitter bots follow Trump?
\item
  What terms have an especially positive or negative sentiment?
\end{enumerate}

You can look at other data sources and even tweets.

         1029731513573822464           the rigged russian witch hunt goes on and on as the “originators and founders” of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity. all credibility is gone from this terrible hoax, and much more will be lost as it proceeds. no collusion!   
         984763579210633216   james comey is a proven leaker \&amp; liar. virtually everyone in washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. he leaked classified information, for which he should be prosecuted. he lied to congress under oath. he is a weak a{\ldots}   
         1027585937163931648  this is an illegally brought rigged witch hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted. it was started and paid for by crooked hillary and the democrats. phony dossier, fisa disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired. 17 angry dems? stay tuned!   
         1031508193107763200                    where’s the collusion? they made up a phony crime called collusion, and when there was no collusion they say there was obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed). if you fight back or say anything bad about the rigged witch hunt, they scream obstruction!

         1023653191974625280    there is no collusion! the robert mueller rigged witch hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an obama white house lawyer) angry democrats, was started by a fraudulent dossier, paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc. therefore, the witch hunt is an illegal scam!   
         977585879651966980                                 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in france yesterday, and we grieve the nation’s loss. we also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support. we are with you @emmanuelmacron!

    \subsubsection{Discussion of Your Plot:}\label{discussion-of-your-plot}

    With this distribution, I wanted to look at the relationship between
sentiments of tweets and their retweet count. The basic scatterplot
above illustrates a blob-like distribution between the two features of
interest. Most data points are contained within a band of values from 0
to 100,000 regardless of polarity. One interesting characteristic of
this plot is the sparse trail of tweets stemming from the center of the
distribution. These tweets have a much higher retweet count than the
rest of the data, yet they are all mostly neutral sentiments. This seems
a bit counterintuitive since one would expect that more emotional
language would lead to a greater reaction within his followers, but this
is not the case. Overall, there doesn't seem to be a clear relationship
between a tweet's sentiment and the amount of retweets it receives.
